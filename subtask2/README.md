## Digital Object Identifier (DOI)


## Introduction

This script is distributed as apart of the Pharmacological Substances, Compounds 
and proteins and Named Entity Recognition (PharmaCoNER) task. It is slightly based 
on the evaluation script from the i2b2 2014 Cardiac Risk and Personal Health-care 
Information (PHI) tasks. It is intended to be used via command line:

<pre>
$> python3 evaluate.py input output
</pre>

It produces Precision, Recall and F1 (P/R/F1) measures for both subtracks.



## Prerequisites

This software requires to have Python 3 installed on your system.


## Directory structure

<pre>
input/
This directory contains the gold standard files and the systems submission files (in this
distribution we include the gold set). Gold standard files must be placed under 
the `ref` directory and system files under the `res` directory. The `ref` directory 
contains two subdirectories with the files for `subtask1` and `subtaks2`. The `res` 
directory can contain one subdirectory with the files for `subtask1` or `subtaks2`. 
Files in the previous directories must be in the appropriate format: `.ann` 
and `subtask1` for `tsv` for `subtask2`. 


output/
